Javascript console game assignment

This is part of the The Odin Project assignment for Javascript section.

Problems Encountered (10Jul2025):
When I try to push my commits to github I got an error of GH007, which
states that if I do any push it will expose my private email. Therefore
I need to use an alternative email specified by github. This is because
I chose to keep my emails private. The problem was easily solved and
documented in the following source:
